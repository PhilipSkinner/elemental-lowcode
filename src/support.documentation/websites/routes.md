# Routes

Each route has:

*   A path
*   A view
*   A controller

## Paths

Paths are used to match incoming HTTP requests and can be used to match dynamic values. Examples of valid paths are:

*   `/`
*   `/posts`
*   `/posts/:id`
*   `/posts/:id/comments`

If a / path is not defined then your website will not host a page on its default route.
