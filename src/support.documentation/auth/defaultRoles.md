# Default Roles

The system comes with a number of pre-defined roles that are used to control access (RBAC) to operations within the system.

Most systems allow these roles to be configured by either replacing them, adding to them or turning off RBAC entirely and just relying upon verification of valid JWT tokens.

Each of these systems default roles can be found within their documentation:

*   [APIs](/src/support.documentation/apis/routes)
*   [Integrations](/src/support.documentation/integrations)
*   [Data Types](/src/support.documentation/data)
*   [Messaging](/src/support.documentation/messaging)
*   [Rulesets](/src/support.documentation/rulesets)
