# Documentation

Elemental is a low(ish) code development system that allows for integrations with existing systems and does not preclude the use of standard applications alongside it.

Each runtime within elemental supports open standards - that is standards that are defined outside of the system and that it complies with.

The following links contain useful information about these standards:

*   [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/)
*   [JSON Web Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token)
*   [Role-based access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)
*   [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)
*   [JSON Path](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/index.html#e2)
*   [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)
