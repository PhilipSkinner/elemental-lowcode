# APIs

APIs allow you to build secure HTTP APIs.

Each API is constructed of:

*   [Routes](/documentation/apis/routes)
*   [Controllers](/documentation/apis/controllers)

The API runtime hosts each API on a path that equals the APIs name. For example, if your API is called books then it will be hosted on:

`http://api.elementalsystem.org/books`
