# Blob Storage

Blob storage allows you to store binary data for your applications/services.

The system supports many blob stores, each one can be backed by a specific storage mechanism. The following mechanisms are supported:

* filesystem

Security can be opened up so a blob stores resources can be accessed via members of the public, or it can be locked down so only users/applications with a valid access token OR a valid one time passcode can access a resource.
